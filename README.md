Resume
======

A simple script to create a pdf version of my resume from markdown and css.

To create your own resume, [fork](https://github.com/johncadengo/Resume/fork) and edit the markdown file under `src/md`.

Outputs html and pdf to the `build` folder. Check out my [resume](https://github.com/johncadengo/Resume/raw/master/build/pdf/john-cadengo.pdf) below,
